 The game is focused on a Radio Control car, 
 which has to go through a series of obstacles 
 (balls, pendulum, ramps...) in a limited time
 (3 laps in 3 minutes, you loose 10 secs when 
 pressing 'M' to reposition the car) 


---------  controls -----------

 Use the arrows to move the car 
 (up and dow to accelerate and brake, 
 left and right for the direction) 

 Mantain 'P' to open the rear wing (DRS)
 and gain speed
